# gh-deployment-workflow
The goal of this project is to help learn the notion of continuous integration and continuous deployment. I will be writing a simple GitHub Actions workflow to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages.
## Requirements
writing a GitHub action that deploys any changes made to the index.html file to GitHub Pages. It should only deploy the file when the index.html file is changed.
